### Coding Interview hmm..

**Interviewing** is a skill that you can get better at by studying, preparing, and practicing for it. Itâ€™s stressful to code in an interview, while someone scrutinizes every liine of code you write. Based on my experiences and Interviews I faced, I am sharing the insights and tips I gained  over the time. I will try to be as discriptive as possible with **Questions**, **Answers** and if possible the `code` as well

* **Question 1**: Write a program to print **fibonacci sequence**  
**Answer**: 

    Fibonacci sequences is `1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ...`. It is always addition of previous `2` values  
    **Formula:**  `Xn = Xn-1 + Xn-2`

     | `bash`      | [fib.sh](bash/fib.sh) |
     | `python`      | [fib.py](python/fib.py)|
     | `golang`      | [fib.go](golang/fib.go)|  

            sh bash/fib.sh
            Fibonacci Sequence from 0 to 10
            ===============================
            0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34


            python python/fib.py
            Fibonacci Sequence from 0 to 10

            go run fib.go

            python python/fib-recursive.py
            Fibonacci Sequence from 0 to 30
            ======================================

* **Question 2**: Write a program to print **Unique Words and Count** from given file without the punctuations  
**Answer**: 
     We will use `tr -d '[:punct:]'` to remove the punctuations
 
   - Using [tr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr_(Unix)) for `bash`
   - Uning [Counter](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html) and [String](https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html) for `python`
