### Coding Interview hmm..

We all have faced problems dealing with uncertainty with *Coding Interviews*. Based on my experiences and Interviews I faced I am trying to put together a repo with **Questions**, **Answer** and if possible the `code` as well

* **Question 1**: Write a program to print **fibonacci sequence**
* **Answer**: Fibonacci sequences is `1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ..`   
          it is always addition of previous `2` values  
          **Formula:**  `Xn = Xn-1 + Xn-2`  
          Here is the code: [fib.py](python/fib.py)  
          
  **Output:**  
          
          python python/fib.py
          Fibonacci Sequence from 0 to 10
          ===============================
          0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
